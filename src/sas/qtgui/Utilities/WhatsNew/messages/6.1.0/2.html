<h1>
    What's New: <i>New and Upgraded Model Editors</i>
</h1>


<p><b>A New editor simplifies reparameterization of existing models</b></p>
<p><b> and a heavily upgraded existing model editor simplifies creation of complex models</b></p>

<p> The "Add Model" tool has been significantly upgraded allowing C models to be
    constructed as well as the ability to enable different options directly
    from the GUI. Finally, the generated code is now heavily documented to make
    clear exactly what the user should do to achieve different effect</p>
<p> The new Reparameterization Editor, based on the same concept as the classic
    Model Editor, now allows the user a relatively simple way to create new
    "parameterizations" of existing models. For example, replacing the core
    radius, shell and core SLDs of the core-shell sphere model with the
    micelle aggregaion number and the fraction of water in the head group
    region assuming known SLDs for the surfactant head and tail.</p>
