    What's New: <i>MuMag Tool</i>
</h1>


<p><b>The new <i>MumMag</i> tool lets you extract micromagnetic properties from a series
   unpolarized neutron experiments.</b></p>

<p><img src="whatsnew/6.1.0/MuMagTool.png" width="600"/></p>



<p>Please note that MuMag is currently designated as experimental software. While the underlying algorithms
   are mathematically robust and have been extensively tested, the tool interface and some advanced features 
   may evolve based on user feedback and ongoing development. We recommend careful validation of results 
   against established methods and welcome feedback from the magnetic scattering community to guide future 
   enhancements.</p>
