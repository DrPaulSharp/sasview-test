    What's New: <i>MuMag - Magnetic Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Analysis</i>
</h1>


<p><b>A sophisticated new experimental tool for analyzing magnetic SANS data is now available in SasView</b></p>
<p><b>featuring advanced micromagnetic modeling and exchange stiffness parameter fitting capabilities</b></p>

<p><img src="whatsnew/6.1.0/MuMagTool.png" width="600"/></p>

<p>The MuMag Tool represents a significant advancement in magnetic scattering analysis, providing researchers with 
   comprehensive capabilities for studying magnetic domain structures and exchange interactions. This specialized 
   tool is designed for analyzing magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data through sophisticated 
   micromagnetic modeling approaches.</p>

<p><b>Advanced Fitting Algorithms and Mathematical Framework</b></p>
<p>The tool employs state-of-the-art numerical methods including non-negative least squares optimization and 
   Jarratt's method of successive parabolic interpolation for parameter refinement. The underlying micromagnetic 
   model accounts for applied magnetic fields, demagnetizing fields, and saturation magnetization effects, 
   enabling precise determination of exchange stiffness constants (A) with rigorous uncertainty quantification 
   using finite difference methods.</p>

<p><b>Dual Geometry Support and Comprehensive Parameter Analysis</b></p>
<p>MuMag supports both perpendicular and parallel scattering geometries, each utilizing different mathematical 
   frameworks optimized for the specific experimental configuration. For perpendicular geometry, the tool fits 
   three key parameters: residual intensity (I_residual), magnetic structure factor (S_H), and longitudinal 
   magnetic scattering (S_M). The parallel geometry focuses on I_residual and S_H parameters, with the 
   mathematical models automatically adapting to the selected configuration.</p>

<p><b>Intelligent Data Import and Processing</b></p>
<p>The tool features intelligent CSV data import capabilities that automatically extract experimental metadata 
   from standardized filename conventions, including applied field values, saturation magnetization, and 
   demagnetizing field parameters. Data filtering is performed based on user-defined q-range limits and 
   minimum applied field thresholds, ensuring optimal fitting conditions.</p>

<p><b>Multi-Tab Visualization and Analysis Interface</b></p>
<p>The comprehensive plotting interface includes three specialized visualization tabs: Data visualization 
   displays imported experimental curves with color-coded field values; Fit Results presents detailed 
   analysis including chi-squared optimization plots, residual intensity distributions, S_H parameters, 
   and (for perpendicular geometry) S_M longitudinal scattering data; and Comparison view overlays 
   experimental data with fitted theoretical curves for validation.</p>

<p><b>Comprehensive Data Export and Documentation</b></p>
<p>Results can be exported in multiple formats including fitted intensity curves, original truncated data, 
   chi-squared optimization parameters, S_H and S_M structure factors with uncertainties, and I_residual 
   values. All exports include comprehensive metadata and timestamp information for complete experimental 
   documentation and reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Experimental Status and Future Development</b></p>
<p>Please note that MuMag is currently designated as experimental software. While the underlying algorithms 
   are mathematically robust and have been extensively tested, the tool interface and some advanced features 
   may evolve based on user feedback and ongoing development. We recommend careful validation of results 
   against established methods and welcome feedback from the magnetic scattering community to guide future 
   enhancements.</p>
