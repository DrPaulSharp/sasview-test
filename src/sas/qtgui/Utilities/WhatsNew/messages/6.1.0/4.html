<h1>
    What's New: <i>Shape2SAS</i>
</h1>


<p><b>Shape2SAS allows the user to construct real space models from simple
      building blocks and generate the resulting SAS curve</b></p>

<p><img src="whatsnew/6.1.0/shape2SASFinal.png" width="600"/></p>

<p>Shape2Sas allows the user to construct arbitrary objects by adding any number
   of shapes from the available menu (currently 10). The size, SLD, placement,
    and orientation in space of each shape (subunit) can be adjusted.
   The resulting object can then be visualized and the expected SAS scattering
   pattern generated.</p>

<p><small>The current version is labelled "experimental" as it has not been thoroughly
   tested and still contains some known issues such as the aspect ratio of the
   real space visualization of the constructed object. We look forward to
   feedback from the community to improve this tool for the next release.</small></p>
